## About
Hello! I'm a New York based UX designer and strategist who brings passion and vision to my work. A graduate of the MFA in Transdisciplinary Design program at Parsons School of Design, I've worked with Fortune 500 clients, startups and agencies to analyze, strategize, conceptualize and design solutions across a variety of sectors. I do the 50,000 foot view of making meaning, but roll up my sleeves and execute my designs with teams and bring them to life.
