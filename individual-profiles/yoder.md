## About
Hello! I'm an independent front-end developer, currently working with custom software consultancies, design and marketing agencies, and small businesses. I contribute features and bug fixes to projects on a variety of platforms, including WordPress, Middleman, and others. I also build and maintain custom WordPress themes. I use HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, jQuery, ReactJS, PHP,  WordPress, Middleman, Gulp, git, and other technologies in my contract work and side projects. 

I'm available for part time or full time remote contract work, or full time remote positions.
